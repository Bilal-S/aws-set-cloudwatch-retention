# aws-set-cloudwatch-retention
Set AWS cloudwatch log retention for all logs in a given region.
After attempting to find an easy way to change the rentention period for a few dozen logs each time and lacking aws direct automation help I created this script.


# configuration
Set the current region if different in config file.
